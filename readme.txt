The assignment has been completed as desired and within the given time. There are six laravel blade files along with a routes file each as per the given information and the user friendly frontend was used from my previous project that I was working on which gives a great user experience of the dashboard. The database consists of 3 tables:
1> user_details:contains user details like emails, passwords etc.
2> new_submissions:new submissions that are made which consists of name, skills location etc.
3> notifications:consists of all configured notifications along with their read or unread status.

There is just one thing that was miss understood by me that as there is a new submission, we have to give the notification if it matches the condition in configured notifications rather I have shown those notifications that are added for the given specified user.
Thank you for your time and consideraion.
